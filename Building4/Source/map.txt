You are inside Building 4 at the entrance on the first floor. There are tables strewn about, with trash and unfinished lunches on them. There is a staircase going up to the second floor above and it appears that the Outtakes store has done some remodeling - it's now underground in a basement. There is a circular area to the east and a hallway to the west.
Type 'help' for a list of commands. The objective of the game is to look for items to equip that will increase your combat power, and defeat other students and teachers in deadly matches of rock-paper-scissors. You can buy and sell items by going down into Outtakes. You should explore the first floor before going up to the second floor. To the east there is an "arena" of sorts; enemies will spawn infinitely there.
